Hello my friend üëã Welcome onboard üõ≥

Suiet wallet kit is a wallet aggregator for DApps to interact with all the wallets in Suiüíß ecosystem easily. ü•≥

Let's try our kit and empower your dapp in minutes. ü™Ñ

:::tip
Sui has released devnet 0.29 and introduced a bunch of new features as well as breaking changes. 
As a professional wallet kit, we also followed up the changes and upgraded our version to 0.2.x.

So We recommend you to walk through our [Migration Guide To 0.2.x](/docs/migration/upgradeTo0.2.x).
:::

> ‚≠êÔ∏è Have fun with [Demo Playground](https://wallet-kit-demo.vercel.app/)

+ [Example repo](https://github.com/suiet/wallet-kit/tree/main/examples/with-vite)

## üî® Setup

First of all, let's install the npm package `@suiet/wallet-kit` to your project.

> npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@suiet/wallet-kit

```shell
npm install @suiet/wallet-kit
# or
yarn add @suiet/wallet-kit
# or
pnpm install @suiet/wallet-kit
```

Then wrap your `<App />` with our context provider, so that our hooks can work nicely inside your dapp.

Oh don't forget to import our css to enable default styles üé®

```jsx
import {WalletProvider} from '@suiet/wallet-kit';
import '@suiet/wallet-kit/style.css';

// take react@18 project as an example
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <WalletProvider>
    <App/>
  </WalletProvider>
);
```

> By default, suiet kit will load all the [preset wallets](./CanIUse#preset-wallets) to the listüí°

## üïπ Place ConnectButton

:::tip
We recommend to use hooks together with our components. But if you want to use our hooks only with your customized UI
components, follow the instruction [#Use Hooks Only](/docs/tutorial/hooks-only)
:::

Just import our `<ConnectButton />` and place it to wherever you like, such as Header.

```jsx
import {ConnectButton} from '@suiet/wallet-kit';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <ConnectButton/>
      </header>
      <
      ... />
    </>
  )
};
```

## ü™ù Use Wallet Capabilities

After your dapp connects to a wallet that
supports [Sui wallet-standard](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/sdk/wallet-adapter/packages/wallet-standard),
your dapp is already empowered and able to call wallet capabilities.üéâ

> Please explore the docs for further usage information üí°

```jsx
import {useWallet} from '@suiet/wallet-kit';
import {TransactionBlock} from "@mysten/sui.js";

const App = () => {
  const wallet = useWallet()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!wallet.connected) return;
    console.log('connected wallet name: ', wallet.name)
    console.log('account address: ', wallet.account?.address)
    console.log('account publicKey: ', wallet.account?.publicKey)
  }, [wallet.connected])

  // launch a move call for the connected account via wallet
  async function handleMoveCall() {
    const tx = new TransactionBlock();
    const packageObjectId = "0x1";
    tx.moveCall({
      target: `${packageObjectId}::nft::mint`,
      arguments: [tx.pure("Example NFT")],
    });
    await wallet.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({
      transactionBlock: tx,
    });
  }

  // launch a move call for the connected account via wallet
  async function handleSignMessage() {
    await wallet.signMessage({
      message: new TextEncoder().encode("Hello World"),
    });
  }

  return (<.../>)
};
```
